# 2.2 Jobs

Jobs are fundamental units of work in a GitHub Actions workflow. Understanding how to configure and manage jobs is essential for building efficient and effective workflows.

## **2.2.1 Job Basics**

- **Definition:** A job is a set of steps that run sequentially on the same runner.
- **Parallel Execution:** By default, jobs run in parallel. You can configure dependencies to control the execution order.
- **Syntax:**
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    job_id:
      runs-on: runner
      steps:
        - name: Step name
          run: command
  ```

## **2.2.2 `runs-on`**

- **Definition:** Specifies the runner environment for the job. Common options include `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `macos-latest`.
- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  ```

## **2.2.3 Job Dependencies**

- **Definition:** Control the execution order of jobs using the `needs` keyword.
- **Syntax:**

  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      needs: build
  ```

- **Example:**

  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      needs: build
      steps:
        - name: Run tests
          run: npm test

    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      needs: test
      steps:
        - name: Deploy application
          run: echo "Deploying application..."
  ```

## **2.2.4 Job Matrix**

- **Definition:** Define a matrix of different configurations to run multiple job instances in parallel.
- **Syntax:**
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      strategy:
        matrix:
          node-version: [10, 12, 14]
      steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Setup Node.js
          uses: actions/setup-node@v2
          with:
            node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        - name: Install dependencies
          run: npm install
        - name: Run tests
          run: npm test
  ```

**Explanation:**

- **strategy.matrix:** Defines the matrix of configurations to run. In this example, the job will run three instances with Node.js versions 10, 12, and 14.

## **2.2.5 Secrets and Environment Variables**

- **Secrets:** Securely store sensitive information and access it in your workflow.
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Use secret
          run: echo ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
  ```
- **Environment Variables:** Define environment variables for your jobs.
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      env:
        MY_VAR: value
      steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Print variable
          run: echo $MY_VAR
  ```

#### Practical Steps:

1. **Create a Workflow with Multiple Jobs:**

   - In your repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Open the `ci-workflow.yml` file you created earlier or create a new file.

2. **Define Multiple Jobs with Dependencies:**
   - Copy the following example into your workflow file:

```yaml
name: Multi-Job Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "14"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy application
        run: echo "Deploying application..."
```

3. **Use a Job Matrix:**
   - Update the `build` job to use a job matrix:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [10, 12, 14]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

4. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
   - Commit the updated workflow file to your repository.
   - Push the changes to GitHub.

```sh
git add .github/workflows/ci-workflow.yml
git commit -m "Add multi-job workflow with dependencies and job matrix"
git push origin main
```

5. **Check the Workflow in Action:**
   - Push a change to the `main` branch to see the workflow trigger.
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository to see the workflow runs and the execution order of jobs.

By completing these steps, you will have a workflow with multiple jobs, job dependencies, and a job matrix. This setup allows you to create more complex and flexible CI/CD pipelines, enhancing the automation of your development processes.
