# 2.1 Events

Events are triggers that start your GitHub Actions workflows. Understanding how to use and configure events is essential for creating effective automation in your projects. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the types of events and how to configure them.

## **2.1.1 Types of Events**

- **Push Events:** Trigger workflows when code is pushed to a repository branch.
- **Pull Request Events:** Trigger workflows when pull requests are opened, synchronized, or closed.
- **Schedule Events:** Trigger workflows on a schedule using cron syntax.
- **Workflow Events:** Trigger workflows based on the completion or status of another workflow.
- **External Events:** Trigger workflows based on external events, such as webhooks.

## **2.1.2 Common Event Types**

- **push:** Triggered when code is pushed to the repository.

  ```yaml
  on: push
  ```

- **pull_request:** Triggered when a pull request is opened, synchronized, or closed.

  ```yaml
  on: pull_request
  ```

- **schedule:** Triggered on a scheduled basis using cron syntax.
  ```yaml
  on:
    schedule:
      - cron: "0 0 * * *"
  ```
- **workflow_dispatch:** Allows manual triggering of workflows.

  ```yaml
  on: workflow_dispatch
  ```

- **repository_dispatch:** Triggered by an external event via GitHub API.
  ```yaml
  on:
    repository_dispatch:
      types: [custom-event]
  ```

## **2.1.3 Event Configuration**

- **Branch Filters:** You can specify which branches to monitor for events.
  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main
        - "release/*"
    pull_request:
      branches:
        - develop
  ```
- **Path Filters:** You can specify which files or directories to monitor for changes.

  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      paths:
        - "src/**"
        - "!src/ignore-this-file.js"
  ```

- **Tag Filters:** You can trigger workflows based on tag creation or deletion.
  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      tags:
        - "v1.*"
  ```

**Example: Multiple Event Triggers**

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    tags:
      - "v1.*"
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - develop
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
```

**Explanation:**

- **push:** Triggers the workflow on pushes to the `main` branch and tags starting with `v1.`.
- **pull_request:** Triggers the workflow on pull requests targeting the `develop` branch.
- **schedule:** Triggers the workflow daily at midnight (UTC).

#### Practical Steps:

1. **Modify Your Existing Workflow to Include Multiple Events:**

   - In your repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Open the `ci-workflow.yml` file you created earlier.

2. **Update the Workflow to Trigger on Multiple Events:**
   - Modify the `on` section of your workflow file to include multiple event triggers. For example:

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    tags:
      - "v1.*"
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - develop
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "14"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

3. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
   - Commit the updated `ci-workflow.yml` file to your repository.
   - Push the changes to GitHub.

```sh
git add .github/workflows/ci-workflow.yml
git commit -m "Update CI workflow to trigger on multiple events"
git push origin main
```

4. **Check the Workflow in Action:**
   - Push a change to the `main` branch or create a pull request targeting the `develop` branch to see the workflow trigger.
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository to see the workflow runs triggered by different events.

By completing these steps, you will have a CI workflow that triggers on multiple events, including pushes to specific branches and tags, pull requests, scheduled times, and manual triggers. This flexibility allows you to automate various aspects of your development process effectively.
