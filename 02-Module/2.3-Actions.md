# 2.3 Steps

Steps are individual tasks that run commands or actions within a job. Each step runs in its own process within the virtual environment specified by the job.

## **2.3.1 Step Basics**

- **Definition:** A step is a discrete action within a job.
- **Order:** Steps within a job run sequentially.
- **Syntax:**
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    job_id:
      runs-on: runner
      steps:
        - name: Step name
          run: command
        - name: Another step
          uses: action
  ```

## **2.3.2 Running Commands**

- **Definition:** Steps can run shell commands directly.
- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Print Hello World
      run: echo "Hello, World!"
    - name: List files
      run: ls -al
  ```

## **2.3.3 Using Actions**

- **Definition:** Steps can use actions, which are reusable units of code defined by the GitHub community or your organization.
- **Syntax:**
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: "14"
  ```

## **2.3.4 Environment Variables**

- **Definition:** You can set environment variables for individual steps.
- **Syntax:**
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Print environment variable
      run: echo $MY_VAR
      env:
        MY_VAR: HelloWorld
  ```

## **2.3.5 Conditional Steps**

- **Definition:** You can conditionally run steps based on the outcome of previous steps or other conditions.
- **Syntax:**

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Always run this step
      run: echo "This always runs"

    - name: Run only if previous step succeeded
      run: echo "Previous step succeeded"
      if: ${{ success() }}

    - name: Run only if previous step failed
      run: echo "Previous step failed"
      if: ${{ failure() }}

    - name: Run based on custom condition
      run: echo "Run this step"
      if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
  ```

## **2.3.6 Step Outputs**

- **Definition:** Steps can produce outputs that subsequent steps in the same job can use.
- **Example:**

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Generate output
      id: generate
      run: echo "::set-output name=myoutput::Hello World"

    - name: Use output
      run: echo "The output is ${{ steps.generate.outputs.myoutput }}"
  ```

## **2.3.7 Secrets in Steps**

- **Definition:** Securely use sensitive information stored as secrets.
- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Use secret
      run: echo ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
  ```

#### Practical Steps:

1. **Modify Your Existing Workflow to Include Various Steps:**

   - In your repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Open the `ci-workflow.yml` file you created earlier or create a new file.

2. **Add Steps to Your Workflow:**
   - Copy the following example into your workflow file:

```yaml
name: CI Workflow with Steps

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Print Hello World
        run: echo "Hello, World!"

      - name: List files
        run: ls -al

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "14"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Generate output
        id: generate
        run: echo "::set-output name=myoutput::Hello World"

      - name: Use output
        run: echo "The output is ${{ steps.generate.outputs.myoutput }}"

      - name: Conditionally run this step
        run: echo "This runs only if previous steps succeeded"
        if: ${{ success() }}
```

3. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
   - Commit the updated workflow file to your repository.
   - Push the changes to GitHub.

```sh
git add .github/workflows/ci-workflow.yml
git commit -m "Add steps to CI workflow"
git push origin main
```

4. **Check the Workflow in Action:**
   - Push a change to the `main` branch to see the workflow trigger.
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository to see the workflow runs and the execution of different steps.

By completing these steps, you will have a workflow with various types of steps, including running commands, using actions, setting environment variables, running conditional steps, and using outputs. This setup allows you to build more detailed and functional CI/CD pipelines, enhancing the automation of your development processes.
