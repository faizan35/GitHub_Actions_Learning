# 2.3 Steps

Steps are individual tasks that run commands or actions within a job. Each step runs in its own process within the virtual environment specified by the job.

## **2.3.1 Step Basics**

- **Definition:** A step is a discrete action within a job.
- **Order:** Steps within a job run sequentially.
- **Syntax:**
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    job_id:
      runs-on: runner
      steps:
        - name: Step name
          run: command
        - name: Another step
          uses: action
  ```

## **2.3.2 Running Commands**

- **Definition:** Steps can run shell commands directly.
- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Print Hello World
      run: echo "Hello, World!"
    - name: List files
      run: ls -al
  ```

## **2.3.3 Using Actions**

- **Definition:** Steps can use actions, which are reusable units of code defined by the GitHub community or your organization.
- **Syntax:**
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: "14"
  ```

## **2.3.4 Environment Variables**

- **Definition:** You can set environment variables for individual steps.
- **Syntax:**
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Print environment variable
      run: echo $MY_VAR
      env:
        MY_VAR: HelloWorld
  ```

## **2.3.5 Conditional Steps**

- **Definition:** You can conditionally run steps based on the outcome of previous steps or other conditions.
- **Syntax:**

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Always run this step
      run: echo "This always runs"

    - name: Run only if previous step succeeded
      run: echo "Previous step succeeded"
      if: ${{ success() }}

    - name: Run only if previous step failed
      run: echo "Previous step failed"
      if: ${{ failure() }}

    - name: Run based on custom condition
      run: echo "Run this step"
      if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
  ```

## **2.3.6 Step Outputs**

- **Definition:** Steps can produce outputs that subsequent steps in the same job can use.
- **Example:**

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Generate output
      id: generate
      run: echo "::set-output name=myoutput::Hello World"

    - name: Use output
      run: echo "The output is ${{ steps.generate.outputs.myoutput }}"
  ```

## **2.3.7 Secrets in Steps**

- **Definition:** Securely use sensitive information stored as secrets.
- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Use secret
      run: echo ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
  ```
