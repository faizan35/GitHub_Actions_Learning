# 2.4 Actions

Actions are the reusable units of code in GitHub Actions workflows. They can be written in JavaScript, Docker, or as composite actions, and they can perform various tasks such as checking out code, setting up dependencies, or deploying applications.

## **2.4.1 Types of Actions**

There are three main types of actions:

1. **JavaScript Actions:** Run directly on the GitHub runner, ideal for cross-platform operations.
2. **Docker Actions:** Run inside a Docker container, useful for consistent environments and dependencies.
3. **Composite Actions:** Combine multiple steps and actions into a single action, useful for reusing common workflows.

#### **JavaScript Actions**

JavaScript actions are run directly in the runner environment. They are written using **Node.js** and can use npm packages.

**Example:**

1. **Create a new directory for your action:**

   ```sh
   mkdir my-js-action
   cd my-js-action
   ```

2. **Create an action metadata file (`action.yml`):**

   ```yaml
   name: "My JavaScript Action"
   description: "A simple JavaScript action"
   inputs:
     name:
       description: "The name to greet"
       required: true
   runs:
     using: "node12"
     main: "index.js"
   ```

3. **Create the main JavaScript file (`index.js`):**

   ```js
   const core = require("@actions/core");

   try {
     const name = core.getInput("name");
     console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
   } catch (error) {
     core.setFailed(error.message);
   }
   ```

4. **Add the necessary dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm init -y
   npm install @actions/core
   ```

5. **Publish your action to the GitHub repository.**

#### **Docker Actions**

Docker actions run inside a Docker container. This allows for a consistent environment across different runs.

**Example:**

1. **Create a new directory for your action:**

   ```sh
   mkdir my-docker-action
   cd my-docker-action
   ```

2. **Create an action metadata file (`action.yml`):**

   ```yaml
   name: "My Docker Action"
   description: "A simple Docker action"
   inputs:
     name:
       description: "The name to greet"
       required: true
   runs:
     using: "docker"
     image: "Dockerfile"
   ```

3. **Create the Dockerfile:**

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM node:12-alpine

   COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
   RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh

   ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
   ```

4. **Create the entry point script (`entrypoint.sh`):**

   ```sh
   #!/bin/sh -l

   echo "Hello, $1!"
   ```

5. **Publish your action to the GitHub repository.**

#### **Composite Actions**

Composite actions allow you to combine multiple steps and actions into a single reusable action.

**Example:**

1. **Create a new directory for your action:**

   ```sh
   mkdir my-composite-action
   cd my-composite-action
   ```

2. **Create an action metadata file (`action.yml`):**

   ```yaml
   name: "My Composite Action"
   description: "A simple composite action"
   inputs:
     name:
       description: "The name to greet"
       required: true
   runs:
     using: "composite"
     steps:
       - name: Print greeting
         run: echo "Hello, ${{ inputs.name }}!"
       - name: Run another action
         uses: actions/checkout@v2
   ```

3. **Publish your action to the GitHub repository.**

**2.4.2 Using Actions from the Marketplace**

The GitHub Marketplace offers a variety of pre-built actions that you can use in your workflows. These actions can simplify your workflow by reusing existing solutions.

**Steps to Use an Action from the Marketplace:**

1. **Navigate to the GitHub Marketplace and find an action you want to use.**

2. **Copy the usage snippet provided by the Marketplace.**

3. **Add the action to your workflow:**

```yaml
name: Example Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  example-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Use an action from the Marketplace
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "14"
```

## **2.4.3 Creating Custom Actions**

Creating custom actions allows you to encapsulate and reuse complex workflows. You can create custom actions in your repository and use them across multiple workflows.

**Steps to Create a Custom Action:**

1. **Create a new directory for your action:**

   ```sh
   mkdir my-custom-action
   cd my-custom-action
   ```

2. **Create an action metadata file (`action.yml`):**

   ```yaml
   name: "My Custom Action"
   description: "A custom action for my workflow"
   inputs:
     name:
       description: "The name to greet"
       required: true
   runs:
     using: "node12"
     main: "index.js"
   ```

3. **Create the main JavaScript file (`index.js`):**

   ```js
   const core = require("@actions/core");

   try {
     const name = core.getInput("name");
     console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
   } catch (error) {
     core.setFailed(error.message);
   }
   ```

4. **Add the necessary dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm init -y
   npm install @actions/core
   ```

5. **Publish your action to the GitHub repository.**
