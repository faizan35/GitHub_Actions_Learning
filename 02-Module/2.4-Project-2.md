### Project 2: Multi-Job Workflow

In this project, you'll create a GitHub Actions workflow that includes multiple jobs running in parallel. You'll use different types of actions in each job and add conditionals to run specific steps based on the outcomes of previous steps.

#### Steps to Complete the Project

1. **Set Up Your Repository**

   If you havenâ€™t already, create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.

2. **Create a `.github/workflows` Directory**

   Navigate to your repository's root directory and create the following directory structure:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

3. **Create the Workflow File**

   Inside the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named `multi-job-workflow.yml`. Open this file in a text editor and add the following content:

```yaml
name: Multi-Job Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "14"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "14"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Deploy application
        run: |
          if [ -z "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}" ]; then
            echo "Deploy key not found, skipping deployment."
            exit 1
          else
            echo "Deploying application..."
            # Insert deployment commands here
          fi

      - name: Notify success
        if: ${{ success() }}
        run: echo "Deployment successful!"
```

**Explanation:**

- **build:** The build job installs dependencies and builds the project.
- **test:** The test job runs only after the `build` job completes successfully (`needs: build`). It installs dependencies and runs tests.
- **deploy:** The deploy job runs only after the `test` job completes successfully (`needs: test`). It conditionally deploys the application based on the presence of a deploy key stored in secrets and notifies success if the deployment succeeds.

4. **Add a Simple Project**

   - Create a basic Node.js project if you don't have one already. In the root directory of your repository, create the following files:

     **`package.json`**

     ```json
     {
       "name": "multi-job-project",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "description": "A project to demonstrate multi-job workflows",
       "main": "index.js",
       "scripts": {
         "build": "echo 'Building project...'",
         "test": "echo 'Running tests...'"
       },
       "author": "Your Name",
       "license": "MIT"
     }
     ```

     **`index.js`**

     ```js
     console.log("Hello, world!");
     ```

5. **Commit and Push Your Changes**

   - Add and commit the workflow file and project files:

   ```sh
   git add .github/workflows/multi-job-workflow.yml package.json index.js
   git commit -m "Add multi-job workflow and basic project"
   git push origin main
   ```

6. **Verify Workflow Execution**

   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository on GitHub.
   - You should see the "Multi-Job Workflow" running. Click on it to view the details.
   - Verify that all jobs run in parallel and that the conditional steps are executed as expected.

#### Summary

In this project, you created a GitHub Actions workflow with multiple jobs running in parallel. You used different actions and incorporated conditionals to manage step execution based on the outcomes of previous steps. This project helps you understand how to structure workflows with complex job dependencies and conditional logic.
