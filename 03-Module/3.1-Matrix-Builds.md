### Module 3: Advanced Workflow Configurations

#### 3.1 Matrix Builds

Matrix builds allow you to run multiple configurations of a job in parallel. This is useful for testing your application across different environments, operating systems, or versions.

**3.1.1 Matrix Strategy Basics**

Matrix strategies enable you to define multiple configurations that GitHub Actions will run in parallel. This is particularly useful for testing different versions of a language or software, different operating systems, or different environment configurations.

**Syntax:**

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        key: [value1, value2, value3]
    steps:
      - name: Step name
        run: command
```

**Example: Node.js Matrix Build**

In this example, a job is configured to run on multiple versions of Node.js:

```yaml
name: Matrix Build Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [10, 12, 14]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

**Explanation:**

- **strategy.matrix.node-version:** Defines a matrix of Node.js versions. The job will run separately for each version (10, 12, 14).

**3.1.2 Dynamic Matrix Configurations**

Dynamic matrix configurations allow you to generate matrix values based on external conditions or previous steps. This can be useful when you need to define a matrix based on variables that are determined at runtime.

**Syntax:**

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        key: [value1, value2, ${{ steps.step_id.outputs.value }}]
    steps:
      - name: Generate dynamic matrix
        id: step_id
        run: echo "::set-output name=value::dynamic_value"

      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Step using dynamic matrix
        run: echo "Running with matrix value ${{ matrix.key }}"
```

**Example: Dynamic Matrix Based on GitHub API**

This example generates a dynamic matrix based on a GitHub API response:

```yaml
name: Dynamic Matrix Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  fetch-matrix:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      matrix: ${{ steps.get-matrix.outputs.matrix }}
    steps:
      - name: Fetch matrix values
        id: get-matrix
        run: |
          # Fetch matrix values from an external API or compute them
          matrix=$(curl -s https://api.example.com/matrix-values)
          echo "::set-output name=matrix::$matrix"

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: fetch-matrix
    strategy:
      matrix:
        key: ${{ fromJson(needs.fetch-matrix.outputs.matrix).values }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Step using matrix values
        run: echo "Running with matrix value ${{ matrix.key }}"
```

**Explanation:**

- **fetch-matrix:** A job to fetch or compute matrix values from an external source and set them as outputs.
- **build:** Uses the matrix values output from the `fetch-matrix` job.

#### Practical Steps:

1. **Create a Workflow with Matrix Builds:**
   - In your repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Create a file named `matrix-build.yml` and add the following content:

```yaml
name: Matrix Builds

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        node-version: [10, 12, 14]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Print OS and Node version
        run: echo "Running on ${{ matrix.os }} with Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}"
```

2. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**

   - Add and commit the matrix build workflow file:

   ```sh
   git add .github/workflows/matrix-build.yml
   git commit -m "Add matrix build workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify Workflow Execution:**
   - Push a change to the `main` branch to trigger the workflow.
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository on GitHub to view the workflow runs.
   - Check the results of the matrix builds across different operating systems and Node.js versions.

By completing these steps, you'll have a workflow that demonstrates the use of matrix builds, allowing for parallel execution across multiple configurations. This setup helps to ensure that your code is tested against different environments and versions, improving its reliability and robustness.
