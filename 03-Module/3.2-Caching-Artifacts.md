### Module 3: Advanced Workflow Configurations

#### 3.2 Caching and Artifacts

Efficient workflows leverage caching and artifacts to speed up build times and share data between jobs. Understanding how to use these features can significantly improve the performance and flexibility of your CI/CD pipelines.

**3.2.1 Using Caches for Dependencies**

Caching dependencies can reduce build times by reusing previously downloaded dependencies instead of fetching them each time a workflow runs.

**Syntax:**

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: path_to_cache
          key: cache_key
          restore-keys: |
            cache_key_prefix-
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: command_to_install_dependencies
```

**Example: Caching Node.js Dependencies**

This example caches `node_modules` to speed up subsequent builds:

```yaml
name: Caching Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Cache Node.js modules
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: node_modules
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
```

**Explanation:**

- **path:** Specifies the directory to cache.
- **key:** Unique identifier for the cache. A change in `package-lock.json` will create a new cache.
- **restore-keys:** Fallback keys to use if the specified key is not found.

**3.2.2 Storing and Retrieving Artifacts**

Artifacts are files generated during a workflow that you want to save for later use or share between jobs. Common use cases include test results, build outputs, or logs.

**Syntax:**

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Store artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: artifact_name
          path: path_to_artifact

      - name: Retrieve artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: artifact_name
          path: path_to_store_artifact
```

**Example: Storing and Retrieving Build Artifacts**

This example stores build outputs and retrieves them in a subsequent job:

```yaml
name: Artifacts Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: build/

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build

    steps:
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: build/

      - name: Deploy application
        run: echo "Deploying application with artifacts..."
```

**Explanation:**

- **Upload Artifact:** Stores the contents of the `build/` directory as an artifact named `build-artifacts`.
- **Download Artifact:** Retrieves the `build-artifacts` artifact and stores it in the `build/` directory.

#### Practical Steps:

1. **Create a Workflow with Caching and Artifacts:**
   - In your repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Create a file named `cache-and-artifacts.yml` and add the following content:

```yaml
name: Cache and Artifacts Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Cache Node.js modules
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: node_modules
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: build/

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build

    steps:
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: build/

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test

    steps:
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: build/

      - name: Deploy application
        run: echo "Deploying application with artifacts..."
```

2. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**

   - Add and commit the cache and artifacts workflow file:

   ```sh
   git add .github/workflows/cache-and-artifacts.yml
   git commit -m "Add cache and artifacts workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify Workflow Execution:**
   - Push a change to the `main` branch to trigger the workflow.
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository on GitHub to view the workflow runs.
   - Check the results of the caching and artifact storing/retrieving steps.

By completing these steps, you'll have a workflow that demonstrates the use of caching and artifacts, enabling more efficient and flexible CI/CD pipelines. This setup helps reduce build times and allows for data sharing between jobs, improving the overall performance and capabilities of your workflows.
