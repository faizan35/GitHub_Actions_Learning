### Project 1: Create a Simple CI Workflow

In this project, you'll create a basic Continuous Integration (CI) workflow using GitHub Actions. This workflow will run every time you push changes to the repository, checking out the code, setting up a programming environment, and running a simple script or test.

#### Steps to Create a Simple CI Workflow

1. **Set Up Your Repository**

   - If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Initialize it with a README file.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Create a `.github/workflows` Directory**

   - In your repository's root directory, create a new directory called `.github`.
   - Inside the `.github` directory, create another directory called `workflows`.

3. **Create the Workflow File**
   - Inside the `workflows` directory, create a new file called `ci-workflow.yml`.
   - Open the `ci-workflow.yml` file in a text editor and add the following content:

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "14"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

**Explanation:**

- **name:** The name of the workflow, displayed in the GitHub Actions interface.
- **on:** The event that triggers the workflow (in this case, `push`).
- **jobs:** The jobs that make up the workflow.
  - **build:** A job named `build`.
    - **runs-on:** The runner environment (`ubuntu-latest`).
    - **steps:** The steps that make up the job.
      - **name:** The name of the step.
      - **uses:** The action to be used in the step.
      - **run:** A command to be run in the step.

4. **Add a Simple Node.js Project**
   - In the root directory of your repository, create a `package.json` file for a simple Node.js project. You can use the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "simple-ci-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Node.js project to demonstrate CI workflow",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Running tests...\" && exit 0"
  },
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

- This `package.json` file includes a simple test script that prints a message and exits successfully.

5. **Commit and Push Your Changes**
   - Add the `ci-workflow.yml` file and `package.json` file to your repository.
   - Commit the changes with a message like "Add CI workflow and Node.js project".
   - Push the changes to GitHub.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Add CI workflow and Node.js project"
git push origin main
```

6. **Check the Workflow in Action**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the "Actions" tab.
   - You should see your "CI Workflow" running. Click on it to see the details of the workflow execution.

By completing these steps, you will have set up a simple CI workflow that runs every time you push changes to the repository. This workflow checks out the code, sets up a Node.js environment, installs dependencies, and runs a simple test script. This project will give you a solid foundation for creating more complex workflows in future modules.
