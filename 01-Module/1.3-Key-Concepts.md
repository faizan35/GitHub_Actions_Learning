# 1.3 Key Concepts

Understanding the key concepts of GitHub Actions is crucial for creating effective workflows. These concepts include workflows, jobs, steps, actions, and runners.

## **1.3.1 Workflows**

- **Definition:** A workflow is an automated process defined in a YAML file within the `.github/workflows` directory of a repository. It is triggered by events and contains one or more jobs.

- **Trigger Events:** Workflows can be triggered by various events such as `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, `release`, etc.

- **Example:**

  ```yaml
  name: Example Workflow
  on: [push, pull_request]

  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Run a script
          run: echo "Hello, world!"
  ```

## **1.3.2 Jobs**

- **Definition:** Jobs are units of work within a workflow. Each job runs on a specific runner and contains a sequence of steps.
- **Parallel and Sequential Execution:** By default, jobs run in parallel. You can configure jobs to run sequentially by defining dependencies.
- **Example:**

  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      needs: build
      steps:
        - name: Run tests
          run: npm test
  ```

## **1.3.3 Steps**

- **Definition:** Steps are individual tasks that run commands or actions within a job. Each step runs in its own process in the virtual environment specified by the job.

- **Types of Steps:** Steps can run commands directly or use actions to perform tasks.

- **Example:**

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: "14"

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
  ```

## **1.3.4 Actions**

- **Definition:** Actions are reusable units of code that perform specific tasks. They can be written in JavaScript or as Docker containers.
- **Using Actions:** You can use actions from the GitHub Marketplace or create your own custom actions.
- **Example:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v2

  - name: Set up Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v2
    with:
      node-version: "14"
  ```

## **1.3.5 Runners**

- **Definition:** Runners are servers that execute the jobs in a workflow. GitHub provides hosted runners, or you can use self-hosted runners.
- **Types of Runners:**
  - **GitHub-Hosted Runners:** Managed by GitHub and provide a range of environments (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows, macOS).
  - **Self-Hosted Runners:** Managed by you, allowing for customized environments.
- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: self-hosted
      steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
  ```

#### Practical Steps:

1. **Create a Workflow with Multiple Jobs and Steps:**

   - In your repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Create a new file called `multi-job-workflow.yml`.

2. **Define a Workflow with Multiple Jobs and Steps:**
   - Copy the following example into your `multi-job-workflow.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Multi-Job Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "14"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy application
        run: echo "Deploying application..."
```

3. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
   - Commit the `multi-job-workflow.yml` file to your repository.
   - Push the changes to GitHub.
   - Check the "Actions" tab in your repository to see the workflow in action.

By understanding and implementing these key concepts, you will be able to create more complex and efficient workflows using GitHub Actions. This knowledge will serve as a strong foundation for advanced topics in subsequent modules.
