# 1.1 What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD tool integrated directly into GitHub repositories. It allows you to automate, customize, and execute software development workflows directly in your repository. Here’s a detailed overview of what GitHub Actions is, its use cases, and its pricing and limits.

## **1.1.1 Overview**

- **Definition:** GitHub Actions is a workflow automation tool that allows you to create custom software development life cycle (SDLC) workflows directly in your GitHub repository. These workflows are defined in YAML files and can be triggered by various events such as push, pull requests, and more.

- **Components:** It consists of workflows, jobs, steps, and actions. Each of these components serves a specific purpose in defining and executing automated tasks.

## **1.1.2 Use Cases**

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically build and test your code every time you push changes to your repository.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploy your application to production after it passes all the required tests.

- **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks such as issue triaging, labelling, and more.

- **Custom Workflows:** Create custom workflows tailored to your project’s needs, such as generating documentation, running security scans, etc.

## **1.1.3 Pricing and Limits**

- **Free Tier:** GitHub provides a generous free tier for public repositories with a limited amount of free minutes for private repositories. The specifics of the free tier include:

  - **2000 minutes per month** for private repositories (GitHub Free for individuals)
  - **Unlimited minutes** for public repositories

- **Paid Plans:** If you exceed the free tier limits, GitHub offers additional plans for purchasing more minutes. These plans vary depending on your usage and organizational needs.

- **Limits:**
  - Maximum workflow run time: **6 hours**
  - Maximum job run time: **72 hours**
  - Maximum number of workflow runs: **20 concurrently for free users**

#### Practical Steps:

1. **Create a GitHub Account (if you don't already have one):**

   - Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for a new account.
   - Set up your profile and create a new repository to start experimenting with GitHub Actions.

2. **Explore the GitHub Actions Documentation:**

   - Visit the [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to get an overview of its features and capabilities.

3. **Set Up a New Repository:**

   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Initialize it with a README file.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

4. **Create Your First Workflow File:**
   - In your repository, create a directory called `.github/workflows`.
   - Inside this directory, create a new file called `main.yml`.
   - Add the following basic workflow configuration to the `main.yml` file:

```yaml
name: First Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run a one-liner script
        run: echo "Hello, GitHub Actions!"
```

5. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
   - Commit the `main.yml` file to your repository.
   - Push the changes to GitHub.
   - Check the "Actions" tab in your repository to see the workflow in action.

By completing these steps, you will have a basic understanding of what GitHub Actions is and how to set up a simple workflow. This foundation will prepare you for diving deeper into more advanced topics in the subsequent modules.
