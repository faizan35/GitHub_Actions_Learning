# 1.2 Understanding Workflows

Workflows are at the heart of GitHub Actions. They define the automated processes that you want to run in your repository. Workflows are defined using YAML syntax and are stored in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.

## **1.2.1 Workflow Basics**

- **Definition:** A workflow is an automated process that you define in your GitHub repository. Workflows are triggered by events and consist of one or more jobs that run in a specific order.

- **Location:** Workflow files are stored in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.

- **File Naming:** You can name your workflow files anything you like, as long as they have a `.yml` or `.yaml` extension.

## **1.2.2 YAML Syntax**

- **YAML Basics:** YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization standard that is commonly used for configuration files. It uses indentation to represent the structure of the data.
- **Example Syntax:**

  ```yaml
  name: CI Workflow
  on: [push]

  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Run tests
          run: echo "Running tests..."
  ```

## **1.2.3 Workflow Files and Configuration**

- **Name:** You can optionally give your workflow a name using the `name` keyword. This name will be displayed in the GitHub Actions interface.

- **Events:** Workflows are triggered by events specified in the `on` section. Common events include `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, and more.

- **Jobs:** A workflow consists of one or more jobs, each of which runs on a specified runner. Jobs are defined in the `jobs` section.

- **Steps:** Each job consists of a series of steps that are executed sequentially. Steps can run commands, use actions, or run scripts.

#### **Example Workflow:**

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "14"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

#### **Explanation:**

- **name:** The name of the workflow.
- **on:** The event that triggers the workflow (`push` in this case).
- **jobs:** The jobs that make up the workflow.
  - **build:** A job named `build`.
    - **runs-on:** The runner environment (`ubuntu-latest` in this case).
    - **steps:** The steps that make up the job.
      - **name:** The name of the step.
      - **uses:** The action to be used in the step.
      - **run:** A command to be run in the step.

## Practical Steps:

1. **Create a New Workflow File:**

   - In your repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Create a new file called `ci-workflow.yml`.

2. **Define a Basic Workflow:**

   - Copy the example workflow provided above into your `ci-workflow.yml` file.
   - Modify the workflow to fit your project. For instance, if youâ€™re using Python, you might want to set up a Python environment instead of Node.js.

3. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
   - Commit the `ci-workflow.yml` file to your repository.
   - Push the changes to GitHub.
   - Check the "Actions" tab in your repository to see the workflow in action.

By completing these steps, you will have a basic workflow set up in your repository. This workflow will run whenever you push changes to the repository, checking out the code, setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running tests. This foundational knowledge will prepare you for more advanced topics in GitHub Actions.
